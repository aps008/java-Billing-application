### Intro

This project is a GUI based billing application just like you see in the supermarket, where different users have different access. It also contains about section where everything about the project is explained. In this project I have added 2 types of role:
- Employee
    - Can add products to cart.
    - Can process payment. `No payment system is not added.`
- Admin
    - Can add employee and other admin.
    - Can add products.
    - Can delete products.

Download: ``git clone https://github.com/aps08/java-Billing-application``

### Few things which need to be taken care of:

- Admin email should be ending with ``@supermart.com``
- Employee email should be ending with ``.emp@supermart.com``
- Phone number should be of 7 digits.
- If you will write something in wrong format it may or may not get entry inside database as there are 
 many trigger associated with it.
- For more information about the project : ``Read the about section inside help button on the first page of the project.``
- It may contain many bugs,  as its impossible to rectify all bugs at one time. If you find any please info me.
- Please do not Use it for your own benefit.
<!-- - Here is the [demo](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu_vHY1svvi8mRjccSpSfbw) of this project. -->
